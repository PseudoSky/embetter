# Embetter
##### Because iframes are janky.
Media embeds can quickly bog your site down, so why not lazy-load them? The basic Embetter "player" consists of a tiny template with a thumbnail image, a play button, and the essential data needed to construct the responsive iframe embed code. Add a dash of javascript & css to your web page, and you have a simple, lightweight media player.
