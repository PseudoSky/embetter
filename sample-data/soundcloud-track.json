  "description": "http://plasticsoundsupply.com/release/drop_logik_-_phase_lift/\n\n\nRecord Label: Plastic Sound Supply\nCatalog Number: PSS024\nArtist: Drop Logik\nRelease: \"Phase Lift\" EP\nGenres: Hip Hop / Sampladelic / Downtempo / Neo Soul / Broken Beat / Beats\nFor fans of: Prefuse73 / Flying Lotus / Machinedrum / Dabrye / Dimlite\nRelease Date: December 16th, 2014\n\n\nAbout the EP: \n\nFour years after appearing on the \"Experimental Dance Breaks 36\" compilation, Drop Logik returns to Plastic Sound Supply with his first solo release on the label: the \"Phase Lift\" EP. This sampladelic slab of boom bap and instrumental hip hop integrates a myriad of related styles in its 20-minute workout. Off-kilter beats and glitched edits are definitive and present, but \"Phase Lift\" is, at its most crucial, thick with ample layers of smooth, heady vibes. Kicking off with staggering beats, swagger and much attitude, the EP strides into a chill neighborhood towards the end, recalling late blunted nights and empty, dimly-lit city streets.\n\n\nAbout the Artist:\n\nDrop Logik is Chad Dixon, an unsung & longtime hero of Denver's underground music scene. Combining his love for hip hop culture, classic samples, new school production, and dynamic performance techniques, Drop Logik continues a long lineage of classic urban sounds with a modern twist. His previous label outings include LPs and EPs on Cold Busted, Black Bridge, and Anarchytechtone.",
